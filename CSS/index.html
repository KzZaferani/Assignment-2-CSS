            I can't remember anything Can't tell if this is true or a dream
            <span id="focused">Deep down inside</span> I feel to scream This
            terrible silence stops me Now that the war is through with me 
            <span id="consciousness">I'm waking up</span>, I cannot see That
            there's not much left of me Nothing is real but pain now
            <span
                >Hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please, God, wake me </span
            >Back in the womb it's much too real In pumps life that I must feel
            But can't look forward to reveal Look to the time when I'll live Fed
            through the tube that sticks in me Just like a wartime novelty Tied to
            machines that make me be Cut this life off from me
            <span
                >Hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please, God, wake me</span
            >
            Now the world is gone, I'm just one Oh God, help me Hold my breath as
            I wish for death Oh please, God, help me
            <span>
                Darkness imprisoning me All that I see Absolute horror I cannot live
                I cannot die Trapped in myself Body my holding cell Landmine has
                taken my sight Taken my speech Taken my hearing Taken my arms Taken
                my legs Taken my soul Left me with life in hell</span
